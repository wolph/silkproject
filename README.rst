Silk
====

Silk is a django app that gives you a simple interface
to deploy and/or rollback to your servers.

Deploying is possible to any server, but build-in support is added for
Amazon AWS EC2 Machines.

Although it is theoretically possible to deploy any project in any language
through any repository, only Python + Virtualenv + Github/Bitbucket are 
tested. For other source code repositories the diff views are not build-in.
